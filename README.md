## App Configuration

1. **Dialogflow Bot Username** and **Dialogflow Bot Password**

    + Create a new user in Rocket Chat from **Administration** -> **Users**. This user should be created with `bot` and `livechat-agent` roles. Optionally, you can also connect this bot user to Dialogflow using this [app](https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.Dialogflow/tree/develop-gsoc).
    
    + Go to **Omnichannel** -> **Departments** -> **New Department** and create a new department. Assign our bot user to that deparment. 
    
    + Then go to **Administration** -> **Livechat** -> **Routing**. There enable `Assign new conversations to bot agent` Setting. This setting will automatically assign a visitor to this bot.
    
    + Copy and paste this newly created Bot user's username and password in respective fields in our app setting.
    
1. **Salesforce Bot Username** and **Handover Target Department Name**

    + Again create a new user, from **Administration** -> **Users**, with `bot` and `livechat-agent` roles and paste this user's username in **Salesforce Bot Username** setting field.
    
    + Then go to **Omnichannel** -> **Departments** -> **New Department** and create a new department. Assign our new bot user to that deparment. Paste this department name in **Handover Target Department Name** setting field.
    
    + Make sure that Dialogflow Bot user and Salesforce Bot user are in different departments.
    
1. **Salesforce Organization ID**

    + To find this value, go to your Salesforce Dashboard -> Setup (In Gear Icon) -> Quick Find Search -> Search for company information -> Click on Company Information option -> Copy Salesforce.com Organization ID value.

1. **Salesforce Deployment ID**

    + To find this value, go to your Salesforce Dashboard -> Setup (In Gear Icon) -> Quick Find Search -> Search for embedded service deployments -> Click on Embedded Service Deployments option -> Locate current chat group and click on View -> From Embedded Service Code Snippets option, click on Get Code -> Locate the value of deploymentId from Chat Code Snippet.

1. **Salesforce Button ID**

    + To find this value, go to your Salesforce Dashboard -> Setup (In Gear Icon) -> Quick Find Search -> Search for embedded service deployments -> Click on Embedded Service Deployments option -> Locate current chat group and click on View -> From Embedded Service Code Snippets option, click on Get Code -> Locate the value of buttonId from Chat Code Snippet.

1. That's it for the configuration. Now let's look at the usage.

## App Usage

1. App should be running right away once you complete all required above configuration. To initiate a session with Live Agent, send a the following message string from your Live Chat widget:

    ```
    initiate_salesforce_session
    ```

1. Sending this string message, should initiate a session with Live Agent. Make sure your Live Agent is online, before making this session request.

1. Once the Live Agent accepts your chat request, it will perform handoff to our Salesforce bot user and then you can send and recieve messages.
